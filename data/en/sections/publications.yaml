- title: "SpaBERT Pretrained Language Models on Geographic Data for Geo-Entity Representation"
  publishedIn:
    name: EMNLP 2022
    # date: 7 June 2020

  paper:
    summary: The paper proposes a novel spatial language model called SpaBERT that captures the spatial context of named geographic entities (geo-entities) in geospatial data. The model is based on the hypothesis that the characteristics of a geo-entity can be inferred by its surrounding entities, similar to word meanings in linguistic context.

  paper:
    summary: The paper proposes a novel model for detecting arbitrarily-oriented objects, such as texts/hands or objects in aerial images. The model evolves the axis-aligned bounding box to an oriented quadrilateral box using contour information.

  paper:
    summary: The paper proposes an unified method, called ChartOCR, to extract data from various types of chart images, including bar charts, line charts, and pie charts. We combine deep learning and rule-based methods to achieve generalization ability and obtain accurate and semantic-rich intermediate results.

- title: "An Automatic Approach for Generating Rich, Linked Geo-Metadata from Historical Map Images"

  paper:
    summary: We present an end-to-end approach that automatically processes historical map images to extract their text content and generate a set of metadata linked to large geographic databases. The approach combines OCR with geocoding to accurately identify location phrases and assign geospatial coordinates.

  paper:
    summary: Many text detection algorithms have been proposed to locate text regions in map images automatically, but most of the algorithms are trained on out-of-domain datasets. This paper introduces a method to automatically generate an unlimited amount of annotated historical map images for training text detection models.

  paper:
    summary: The paper proposes a template-based learning approach for computer vision tasks, where multiple instances of a concept are available. The method dynamically predicts weights that consider noise and redundancy to aggregate image-level features into a single template-level representation.
